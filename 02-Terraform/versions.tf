# Terraform and provider version constraints
# ==============================================================================
# Pinning versions is what makes infrastructure reproducible. Without these
# blocks, `terraform init` resolves the newest provider available on the day it
# runs — so the same code can produce a different plan next month, or fail
# outright after a major-version release removes an argument.
