# ==============================================================================
# Terraform Backend Bootstrap
# ==============================================================================
# Solves the chicken-and-egg problem: the main configuration stores its state in
# an S3 bucket, but that bucket has to exist before `terraform init` can run.
#
# This is a SEPARATE root module that uses LOCAL state on purpose. It creates
# exactly one thing — the state bucket — and is run once, ever.
#
#     cd 02-Terraform/bootstrap
#     terraform init
#     terraform apply
#     # copy the bucket name into ../backend.hcl
#
# Its own terraform.tfstate describes a single bucket, so losing it is a
# five-minute `terraform import`, not a disaster. Commit it or don't; it holds
# nothing sensitive.
#
# NOTE: no DynamoDB lock table. Terraform 1.10+ locks state with a conditional
# write on an S3 object (`use_lockfile = true` in ../backend.tf), which makes
# the separate table redundant. It was deprecated in Terraform 1.11.
